# webParanoia
Remastered version of JParanoia, rewritten within Node.js

# Installing dependencies
Install the latest version of node.js and npm, and run `npm install` in the root directory. 

Alternatively, after installing node.js and npm, just run `setup.bat`.

# Modifying client sources
If you ran `setup.bat`, this section is unnecessary. To update `client.css` and `client.js` from the source files, just run `setup.bat` again.

Run `npm install` in the `client_src` directory, followed by `npm install -g gulp-cli`. To update `client.css` and `client.js` from the source files, run `gulp` in the `client_src` directory.

# Starting the server
Run `start_server.bat`. The GM's view will automatically open in the web browser.
